    <h2>Things that help me learn code:</h2>
    <ul>Google</ul>
    <p>Pretty much any time there is any uncertainty in starting or progressing a project, Google always helps point me to a
      stack overflow page or W3 page that clears things up and gets ideas flowing. My go to option when I am stuck.
    </p>
    <ul>Github</ul>
    <p>With the amount of people that use Github, chances are that somebody else has already done something very similar to any
      kind of project I may need to do. Looking at other developers' code helps me learn new techniques and also gives a good
      foundation for anything that may be confusing to me.

    <h2>Things I struggle with while learning code:</h2>
    <ul>Going down the rabbit hole</ul>
    <p>Sometimes it can get pretty overwhelming seeing all the cool stuff that is out there. If I'm confused/intrigued by one thing,
      I'll look into it for a better understanding, but then get linked to other pages with even more confusing/interesting topics.
      It can get to the point where I end up on a page that has absolutely nothing to do with the current project I am working on and
      lead to nothing getting accomplished.
    </p>
    <ul>Knowing where to start</ul>
    <p>There are a lot of different ways to accomplish any single thing when it comes to programming and it is hard when I don't know
      the "proper" way to do something. This can discourage experimentation which is one of the best ways to learn.
